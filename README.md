<h2>Investigation - Defaced</h2>


<h2>Scenario:</h2>

Mike is a young entrepreneur that recently started a pharmaceutical company online that supplies personal health products. As the business is growing at a rapid pace, Mike pressured the developers to create a website as quickly as possible and disregarded time-consuming security measures. Unsurprisingly, after the website went live it was defaced by a threat actor that also stole all the database records. Learning from this incident Mike took down the server and began security testing and investigation. He setup a forwarder to send server logs to a SIEM and used a file integrity monitoring solution to get alerts when files are modified on the server. You are provided with the alerts generated from the file integrity monitoring tool, stored on the Desktop as FIM1.JPG and FIM2.JPG. You also have screenshots of the website homepage before and after the compromise, saved as; Before.JPG and After.JPG.

<h2>Questions:</h2>

Q3. What is the scanner used by the attacker to identify the vulnerability? (3 points)

- Start by going through our available fields. It is pretty limited in what we can search for.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6GgHyDd.png" height="10%" width="20%" alt="fields"/>


- So I start filtering with 'verb' aka HTTP commands. Removing GET and POST and making sure a verb 'exists'. I start looking at each individual command for suspicious logs. Dropped the log count to 26.

- From the remaining logs there are 2 suspicious events.

- A quick search through google helps us find what NIKTO is.

Q4. Which PHP page is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI)? (2 points)

- Personally had no idea what RFI was and how it worked. So I did a quick google search.
- According to google: "RFI is a type of vulnerability that allows an attacker to include a remote file, usually through a script on the web server. This can occur due to improper handling of user inputs in the PHP code, particularly in functions or statements that include files."
Cool. So I'm going to try look for a file that was downloaded from a suspicious site.
- So the verb I filter for is 'GET' looking for any suspicious PHP file. Pretty much immediately I find a suspicious sounding file called 'backdoor.jpg.php'. 
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/sL728vf.png" height="100%" width="100%" alt="RFI"/>

- Filtering for backdoor.jpg.php we find out it was downloaded through mediafire with a parameter called getimageonly.php.

Answer: getimagesonly.php

Q5. What is the IP address of the remote attacker? (3 points)

- I just looked at the IP that was trying to download the suspicious file from the previous question.

Answer: 91.192.103.35

Q6. What is the name of the PHP shell? (2 points)

- I had no clue what a PHP shell was either so I had to do some research on that.
- According to google: "HP Shell or Shell PHP is a program or script written in PHP (Php Hypertext Preprocessor) which provides Linux Terminal (Shell is a much broader concept) in Browser. PHP Shell lets you to execute most of the shell commands in browser, but not all due to its limitations"
- Cool so I knew to look for a PHP file, lucky for me I had a good idea where to look. 'backdoor.jpg.php'. Clearly a suspicious sounding PHP file pretending to be a JPG file.

Answer: backdoor.jpg.php
<br />
<br />

Q7. The attacker downloaded the PHP shell from a file-hosting website. What is the name of the website? (2 points)

- This ones pretty self explanatory, we saw from question 4 where the file was downloaded from.

Answer: mediafire.com
<br />
<br />

Q8. What time was the first command executed through the PHP shell? (3 points)

-We search through the logs with the PHP shell file. Looking at the time from when it was downloaded onwards. I can see the command 'whoami'

Q9. Which config file does the attacker attempt to read using the command 'cat'? (2 points)

Q10. At what time was the database dumped by the attacker? (2 points)

-A quick google search tells me a database dump file extension would be db or dump. So I try filtering for those two. I find a log with the message saying 'db_export.php'.

Q11. The attacker exfiltrated the database records. What is the database name? (Just the name, without any extension) (2 points)

-I look at the details of the request to export the database. I can see the name of the database.
